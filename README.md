### Schemas
Describe what data can be queried:
[https://graphql.org/learn/schema/](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/)

###Â Resolvers

- **GraphQLResolver**: to resolve complex types. For scalar fields, getter and setter methods will be enough. However, for fields with complex types (like author in Book), you have to use Resolver objects to resolve the value of those fields.
Resolver objects implement the interface GraphQLResolver.
- **GraphQLMutationResolver**: to define the operations of the root Mutation type.
- **GraphQLQueryResolver**: to define the operations of the root Query type.
- **GraphQLSubscriptionResolver**: to define the operations of the root Subscription type.

# Welcome to GraphiQL
#
# GraphiQL is an in-browser tool for writing, validating, and
# testing GraphQL queries.
#
# Type queries into this side of the screen, and you will see intelligent
# typeaheads aware of the current GraphQL type schema and live syntax and
# validation errors highlighted within the text.
#
# GraphQL queries typically start with a "{" character. Lines that starts
# with a # are ignored.
#
# An example GraphQL query might look like:
#
#     {
#       field(arg: "value") {
#         subField
#       }
#     }
#
# Keyboard shortcuts:
#
#  Prettify Query:  Shift-Ctrl-P (or press the prettify button above)
#
#       Run Query:  Ctrl-Enter (or press the play button above)
#
#   Auto Complete:  Ctrl-Space (or just start typing)
